# 2. Hausaufgabe - TDD & Pair Programming

## Aufgabe 2-2

**Did your implementation at
any point do more than just
satisfy the already existing
(i.e., not-ignored) test cases?**: 
  - we tried only satisfying the test cases
  - at some point it was harder than writing a more generic code
**Did you have a rough idea how
to approach this problem after
reading the task description?
How did this approach
work out with the test cases?** 
  - we already had an idea how everything should be implemented
  - implementation would have been complexer however
  - test cases helped for less complex and more reliable code
**At which points in your process
did you refactor? Why?** 
  - small refactoring on 2. test case (further student appears)
  - big refactoring when student array is given instead of the hard-coded one
**At which points did you learn
something new about the
problem, and how well could
your design up to this point
handle these discoveries?**
  - student array was not mentioned in the task description
  - given student array was not alphabetically sorted
**Did you add any further test
cases?**
  -we wrote 2 helper functions and test cases for them
