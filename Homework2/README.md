# 2. Hausaufgabe - TDD & Pair Programming

## Aufgabe 2-2

1. 
  - we tried only satisfying the test cases
  - at some point it was harder than writing a more generic code
1. 
  - we already had an idea how everything should be implemented
  - implementation would have been complexer however
  - test cases helped for less complex and more reliable code
1. 
  - small refactoring on 2. test case (further student appears)
  - big refactoring when student array is given instead of the hard-coded one
1. 
  - student array was not mentioned in the task description
  - given student array was not alphabetically sorted
1. we wrote 2 helper functions and test cases for them
